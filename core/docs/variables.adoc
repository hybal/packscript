= Variables
:hardbreaks:


In PackScript there are two kinds of variables, local and global. Local variables are declared with the `let` keyword and global variables with `set`.
[source, packscript]
----
let local = 1
set global = 2
----

there is also a difference in how you refer to these variables. Local variables are used normally without any differences, but to use a global variable you have to prefix it with `g:` (*This will likely change!!*)
[source, packscript]
----
let local = 1

print local #nothing different

set global = "xyz"

print g:global #prefixed with g:
----

Local variables are _local_ to the current scope.
[source, packscript]
----
let example (a,b) = {
    let local = a * b #local is defined here and can be used throughout this scope
    print local
    local
}

#local can no longer be used here
