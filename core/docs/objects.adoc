= Objects
:hardbreaks:

Objects in PackScript are data structures that are essentially hashmaps.
They can be defined using curly braces ({}) and members are assigned using colons (:)
[source, packscript]
----
let user = {
    name: "John Smith",
    age: 35,
    email: "jsmith@example.com",
    address: {
        street: "123 Main Street",
        state: "NY",
        city: "New York"
    }
}
----

You can also create a _type_, which is just an object that can only have some specific members.
The syntax is slightly different in that instead of values you have types (see [types]) 
[source, packscript]
----
type Project {
    id: str,
    displayName: str,
    author: str,
    language: str,
    version: number,
}

----

Then to create a new object of that type you just write the name of the type before the braces.
[source, packscript]
----
let example_project = Project {
    id: "example",
    displayName: "Example Project",
    author: "ellipse12",
    language: "packscript",
    version: 1
}
----

to access the individual members of an object you can use the dot (`.`) operator.
[source, packscript]
----
print example_project.displayName
